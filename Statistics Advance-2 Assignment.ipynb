    "The PMF is used for discrete random variables, which take on a finite or countable number of distinct values. It gives the probability of a specific outcome occurring. Mathematically, for a discrete random variable X, the PMF is denoted as P(X = x), where \"x\" represents a particular value that X can take.

Unlike the PMF, the value of the PDF at a single point doesn't give a meaningful probability, as the probability of a single exact value is zero in a continuous distribution.\n",

Here are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model:\n",

    "* Height of Individuals: The heights of a population often follow a normal distribution. The mean represents the average height, and the standard deviation indicates how much the heights vary around that average.\n",
