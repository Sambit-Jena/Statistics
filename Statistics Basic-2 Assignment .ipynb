    "Outliers can have a significant impact on measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (e.g., range, variance, standard deviation). Outliers are extreme values that are significantly different from the rest of the data points in a dataset. Their presence can distort the characteristics of the data and affect the interpretation of statistical measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean: The mean is sensitive to outliers because it considers all data points equally. If there are extreme values in the dataset, the mean can be pulled towards them, causing it to no longer represent the typical or central value of the majority of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Median: The median is less affected by outliers. Since it represents the middle value in the dataset, it is not influenced by extreme values at the tails of the distribution. Therefore, the median is often preferred over the mean when dealing with skewed or outlier-prone data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mode: The mode represents the most frequent value(s) in the dataset. Outliers usually do not impact the mode unless they become the most frequently occurring value, which is rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Range: The range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset, can be significantly affected by outliers. The presence of outliers can lead to an overestimation of the spread of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance and Standard Deviation: Both variance and standard deviation are based on the squared differences between each data point and the mean. Outliers, with their large deviations from the mean, can dramatically increase the variance and standard deviation, indicating greater dispersion in the data than what may actually be true.\n",
