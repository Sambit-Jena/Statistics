    "Both t-tests and z-tests are statistical tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. \n",

    "* T-Test:\n",
    "A t-test is used when the sample size is small (typically less than 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown. It relies on the t-distribution, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by estimating the population standard deviation from the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Z-Test:\n",
    "A z-test is appropriate when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30) or when the population standard deviation is known. It is based on the standard normal distribution and is more accurate under these conditions due to the central limit theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases.\n",

    "\n",
    "* T-Test:\n",
    "Imagine a pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug to lower blood pressure. They recruit a small sample of 20 individuals with hypertension and measure their blood pressure before and after taking the drug. Since the sample size is small, and the population standard deviation of blood pressure is unknown, a paired t-test would be appropriate to compare the means of the paired samples (before and after the drug) to determine if the drug has a statistically significant effect on reducing blood pressure.\n",

    "Consider an example where we are conducting a survey to estimate the average height of all students in a large university. W collect data from a random sample of 200 students, and we happen to know the population standard deviation of height from previous research. In this case, a z-test would be suitable for testing whether the average height of our sample differs significantly from the known population average height."
